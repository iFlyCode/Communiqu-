/**
 * This package contains utility classes for <code>JavaTelegram</code> which may be used by other developers in the
 * future, but are not directly related to the central operation of <code>JavaTelegram<code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, something like <code>JTelegramFetcher</code> goes in the utilities package because one would use it to
 * access the API, but only to aid in the getting of recipients, something which is not entirely related to the sending
 * of telegrams through the API.
